The project enabled Latin American HEIs to make use of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to provide analytics tools to academic decision makers. Traditionally, academic decision makers make use of the available data through simple report generation tools (Data cubes, Ad-hoc queries).  The added-value of this type of tools is limited given that can only present to the decision maker a picture of what happened before.  Learning Analytics tools use more advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to not only present what happened, but also estimate what can happen if the current trend continues (for example Drop-out early warning systems) or to provide information about how to optimize an existing process (for example a tool to improve current Curricula).

<h4> Objectives </h4> 

- To develop a framework that describes the methodological, technical, institutional, ethical and communal aspects of the deployment of Learning Analytics in the context of Latin American higher education institutions.
 -To adapt two existing tools created originally in the context of Europe to the Latin American context. One will be directed to academic administrators and the other to professors and counsellors.
- To develop the LALA Handbook, a guide containing the LALA methodology, the infrastructure, the adoption experience and best-practices.
