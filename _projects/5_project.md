The Santa Ana parish in Cuenca, Ecuador has a collection of ten educational institutions aimed at young people between 12 and 18 years of age who lack the necessary tools and motivation to continue with their higher education studies. In addition, the knowledge in Information and Communication Technologies in these institutions present a gap with respect to the rest of the institutions of the Cuenca Canton. The project seeks to reduce the existing digital gap in the students of the Santa Ana parish and provide them with new opportunities for knowledge. Technology is the channel that will allow the participants of this project to improve their skills in the educational and social field, which will have a positive impact on their future working life.
